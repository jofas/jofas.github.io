        About
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-padding">
        In the summer of 2016 I wrote my first program (a Windows Forms app
        written in VB.NET, believe it or not).
        Quickly afterwards I became so enamored with programming that I made
        it my profession.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-padding">
        Since then I've successfully attained two higher education degrees in
        computing, became a FLOSS contributor, created and maintained a
        microservice application with over seventy thousand lines of code for
        several years all by myself, programmed supercomputers including a
        neuromorphic one with over one million cores
        (<a class="underline decoration-1" href="http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/" target="_blank">SpiNNaker</a>)
        and tried to
        <a class="underline decoration-1" href="static/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">teach machines how to see</a>
        and
        <a class="underline decoration-1" href="static/cp_for_loan_approval_prediction.pdf" target="_blank">how
          to conservatively predict whether a loan request is likely to default.</a>
        I learned a lot, failed many times and had the time of my life doing it
        all.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-padding">
        After graduating in the fall of 2020 I became a freelancing software
        engineer, because I wanted to explore and experience the process of
        developing software to the fullest.
        I had the privilege of working with true masters of the craft during my
        studies.
        Having learned a lot from them and having witnessed what they are able
        to do, I hope I can follow in their footsteps.
        Therefore I'm trying my best to develop simple, well-tested, secure,
        useful and accessible software.

              The idea of teaching computers how to solve complex tasks based on

              My code, my responsibility.
              Bugs in production are annoying and potentially dangerous.
              Mistakes should be caught as early in the development cycle as
              possible.
              Not only to prevent security issues, but also from the standpoint of
              cost.
              Two days spent on a decent test suite today has the potential of
              saving a lot of time and money tomorrow.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Software engineering has a lot to do with gut feeling.
              Sometimes you find ideas along the way that feel like they have the
              potential of creating something amazing.
              Instead of rigidly focusing on the backlog, I believe these ideas
              have to be explored immediately.
              I grant myself the freedom to do so.

            <p>
              Deleting code is better than writing it.
              Feature creep and entropy result in software that dies before it
              should.
              I apply teachings from the Extreme Programming, UNIX and TDD
              philosophies to my work.
              My focus lies on creating lean, extensible, decoupled and long-living
              software.
              If I think a feature does not fit these design principles, I will tell
              you so and I expect you to be open to negotiation.

              Programming is the art of expressing computation for a computer to

              Software engineering is the art of enabling other engineers to
              understand, use, change and extend a program.
              I'm striving to find the simplest possible solution by (I) using the
              right level of abstraction, (II) sensibly dividing a problem into
              more manageable sub-problems and (III) by developing a
              self-explanatory and consistent API.

              I think code that is hacked together by a sleep-deprived
              individual at two o'clock in the morning, right before a deadline
              is never ready for production.
              Deadlines are artificial constructs.
              Estimates are faulty and seldom correct.
              I prefer to focus on my work, on doing it the right way, rather
              than getting caught up in this wasteful game.

              The platform served car dealers wanting to provide their

              Car dealers used a web client for selling insurance products

              Applied an adaptation of the conformal prediction method to the

              The goal was to save the bank money by rejecting loan requests likely

              17% of all declined requests were filtered out by the algorithm while

              It all started 2020 during the first wave of COVID-19.
              Because traveling abroad was virtually impossible due to quarantine
              measurements, a couple of friends decided to spend a three day weekend
              holiday trip exploring the countryside of the Bergisches Land, our
              birthland.
              I joined and instantly fell in love with backpacking.
              Since then I did a few trips through Germany and the Scottish
              Highlands.
              The longest hike I did so far was a hundred miles from Fort William to
              Aviemore in seven days.
              My goal is to one day walk a two thousand mile trail.

              In my childhood and youth I played basketball in a club.
              Nowadays my focus lies more on functional fitness and being a
              healthy, fit and injury-free person.
              I like to perform the occasional olympic or power lift and enjoy
              squash.
              I recently started to go running again and was tremendously
